# Given

```bash
Driver is an easy Windows machine that focuses on printer exploitation. Enumeration of the machine reveals that a web server is listening on port 80, along with SMB on port 445 and WinRM on port 5985. Navigation to the website reveals that it&amp;amp;amp;#039;s protected using basic HTTP authentication. While trying common credentials the `admin:admin` credential is accepted and we are able to visit the webpage. The webpage provides a feature to upload printer firmwares on an SMB share for a remote team to test and verify. Uploading a Shell Command File that contains a command to fetch a remote file from our local machine, leads to the NTLM hash of the user `tony` relayed back to us. Cracking the captured hash to retrieve a plaintext password we are able login as `tony`, using WinRM. Then, switching over to a meterpreter session it is discovered that the machine is vulnerable to a local privilege exploit that abuses a specific printer driver that is present on the remote machine. Using the exploit we can get a session as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

ip/scope: 10.10.11.106

# Steps

How did I solve it

# Findings

- Open ports:
	- HTTP (80), RDP (135), SMB (445), Cloud Witness (5985)
- Visiting the ip on a browser shows a login form.
	- Looking at the login request on `burpsuite` and making an invalid request returns a response where the header references the user `admin`
- Admin panel has weak creds, password is also `admin`

# Creds

- Website creds: `admin:admin`
- User creds from someone accessing the share:

```bash

TONY::DRIVER:5a42fba6465e871c:577360343d389e60e26eb8a49dcb2c18:0101000000000000eb7df98226dadb01b429baed022872a900000000020000000000000000000000:liltony
