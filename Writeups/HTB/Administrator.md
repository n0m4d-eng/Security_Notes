# Given

`Administrator` is a medium-difficulty Windows machine designed around a complete domain compromise scenario, where credentials for a low-privileged user are provided. To gain access to the `michael` account, ACLs (Access Control Lists) over privileged objects are enumerated, leading us to discover that the user `olivia` has `GenericAll` permissions over `michael`, allowing us to reset his password. With access as `michael`, it is revealed that he can force a password change on the user `benjamin`, whose password is reset. This grants access to `FTP` where a `backup.psafe3` file is discovered, cracked, and reveals credentials for several users. These credentials are sprayed across the domain, revealing valid credentials for the user `emily`. Further enumeration shows that `emily` has `GenericWrite` permissions over the user `ethan`, allowing us to perform a targeted Kerberoasting attack. The recovered hash is cracked and reveals valid credentials for `ethan`, who is found to have `DCSync` rights ultimately allowing retrieval of the `Administrator` account hash and full domain compromise.

## Enumeration

I started with the usual Rustscan to find out which ports could be open, and a full port scan in the background.

```

The nmap scan showed me that a number of services were running on the target. Also, the host seems to be called `DC` which could mean that this is the domain controller, running Windows.

```bash title="running services"
- FTP(22)
- DNS(53)
- Kerberos(88)
- RPC(135)
- LDAP(389)
- SMB(445)
- HTTP(5985)
```

I decided to test out the services to see what I could get. I decided to use the given credentials to see what I could access.

**FTP**

**SMB**
I ran a check for Null sessions out of habit, and didn't turn up anything. 
![](Assets/Pasted%20image%2020250714212046.png)

After that, it was time to enumerate shares with the creds I had on hand. This showed me that the user olivia could read some of the shares, and that was it.

![](Assets/Pasted%20image%2020250714212137.png)

Since she could see some of the shares, I tried to see if she could enumerate users with `rid-brute`. This have me some results, and I was able to see that the domain was called `administrator.htb`. I put that in my `/etc/hosts` file along with `DC.administrator.htb` for the domain controller.

![](Assets/Pasted%20image%2020250714212418.png)

As a side note, I went ahead and used netexec to come up with the list of domain users. Just in case I had to build a list of user names to bruteforce/spray or whatever. 

**LDAP**
![](Assets/Pasted%20image%2020250714213818.png)

It was becoming more and more clear that I needed bloodhound to help me visualise the connections between all these accounts and groups. So I used the LDAP protocol and bloodhound ingestor to gather more info

![](Assets/Pasted%20image%2020250714214259.png)

I fed the ingestor data into Bloodhound, and started at Olivia. I marked her account as "owned" since we're starting with her breached creds.

![](Assets/Pasted%20image%2020250714215856.png)

Looking at the outbound connections showed me that olivia had `GenericAll` permissions over an account called michael. And michael had `ForceChangePassword` permissions over an account called benjamin, who was part of the share moderators group. 

Bloodhound gives users a pretty good idea of what kind of attack is appropriate for exploiting certain relationships in an AD environment.

## Exploitation

**Olivia -> Michael**

In order to get to michael, I would have to exploit olivia's `GenericAll` permissions. I used Samba's net tool to change michael's password.

`net rpc password "michael" "newpass2025" -U "ADMINISTRATOR"/"olivia"%"ichliebedich" -S 10.10.11.42`

I then proceeded to try to get into michel's system using `evil-winrm` .

`evil-winrm -i 10.10.11.42 -u michael -p newpass2025`

I didn't really find anything there, so I left it

![](Assets/Pasted%20image%2020250715091827.png)

 **Michael -> Benjamin**

I used the permission michael had over benjamin's account, and changed the password using the same method I used to get into Michael's account. After that I tried SMB, and evil-winrm but I didn't get anything out of either. 

I looked at FTP which was previously inaccessible with Olivia's creds. Turns out, this works and I managed to get my hands on a file called `Backup.psafe3`. 

I used `psafe2john` to dump the hash in the file, and then used John on it. At the same time, I ran Hashcat. 

`hashcat -m 5200 -a 0 -o backup.psafe.cracked Backup.psafe3 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

Hashcat finished first, with a password. "Password Safe" is basically a credential vault software. You install it, and then open the `Backup.psafe3` file on it. This showed me three sets of credentials. 

I used evil-winrm to test each one, and emily's worked. The user flag was on her desktop.

## Escalation to Root

Now that I got into emily's account, I need to check if I can find a way to escalate my level of access either on her system, or by getting access to a user that does have admin access. I tried to run some powershell scripts in order to see if I could 

enumerate this account, but I didn't get very far. Since this is an AD machine, I figured I'd move onto some other user accounts, that have access to the domain admin.

I decided to go back to bloodhound, and look at emily's relationships. Emily has `GenericWrite` access over Ethan.

![](Assets/Pasted%20image%2020250715123722.png)

Bloodhound suggested a targeted Kerberoast. I can possibly get a kerberos hash from this and crack it offline.

So I tried using both `targetedkerberoast.py` and `netexec`. Both worked but trying them out helped me figure out the syntax, and what it all meant. There was a clock skew error to start with but were overcome by chaining `ntpdate` or `faketime`.

![](Assets/Pasted%20image%2020250715131347.png)

![](Assets/Pasted%20image%2020250715132037.png)

The next step was to see if this hash is crackable using hashcat. It could work if the password was weak enough.

And it did work, giving me ethan's password on administrator `limpbizkit`.

Looking at the user ethan on bloodhound showed me that ethan had some permissions over the administrator user on the domain controller. The important ones are `GetChanges` and `GetChangesAll`. These two permissions give ethan the ability to execute a DCSync attack and dump the hashes for the users on the domain.

![](Assets/Pasted%20image%2020250715123621.png)

For this I went with `secretsdump.py`.

`impacket-secretsdump ADMINISTRATOR/'ethan':'limpbizkit'@ADMINISTRATOR.HTB -just-dc-ntlm`

This gave me the hashes for the users on this domain. Allowing me to grab the administrators hash

After that, it was back to evil-winrm to log in as the administrator. The root flag was on the desktop.
